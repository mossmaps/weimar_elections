    <p class="summarytext">Taking place just three months after the Nazis’ dramatic electoral gains in July, this round of voting suggested a slight shift in the political mood. Fewer voters showed up at the polls than in the previous election’s record turnout, although, at 80.6%, the November turnout still surpassed that of every election in the 1920s. More importantly, the Nazi Party received two million fewer votes than in July, with some of those erstwhile voters casting their ballots for other parties and others simply staying home.

    <p class="summarytext">With one-third of the seats, the NSDAP remained the largest party in the Reichstag, but now by a narrower margin, having seen its share of the national vote decline by over four percent and its number of seats by 34. The KPD, meanwhile, registered the biggest percentage increase of any party, adding 2.6% to its national share (now at 16.9%) and 11 seats to its parliamentary contingent. This made the Communists the third-largest faction in the legislative body, propelling them past the Catholic bloc of Z/BVP for the first time in the Republic. Further complicating the political picture, the far-right DNVP also increased its share by roughly the same percentage as the far left and added more than a dozen seats to its faction in the Reichstag. As a consequence, the three explicitly anti-republican parties—the NSDAP, the KPD, and the DNVP—now held almost 60% of the seats in the Republic’s lawmaking body.

    <p class="summarytext">A closer look at individual districts reveals the fluctuations in voting between July and November more clearly than simply a glance at the national maps. Hamburg, for instance, appeared as a brown sliver on the July map, but switched to salmon-colored in November, lending the impression that the SPD had gained votes in the intervening three months. In fact, both the SPD and the NSDAP lost votes in that district, but the Nazis did so at a much more precipitous rate (6.2%) than the SPD (3%). Meanwhile, the KPD and the DNVP each increased their share of the Hamburg vote by 4%, reflecting continued growth at both political extremes, even as support for the Nazis seemed to have crested.

    <p class="summarytext">The November elections initially seemed only to have perpetuated the Reichstag’s deadlock, given the refusal of the other parties to include the NSDAP or the KPD in a coalition and the impossibility of forming a majority without one of them. The elections did, however, alter the calculations of some conservative advisors around the President. The growing popularity of the KPD frightened them into reconsidering a government with the NSDAP, and the latter’s slightly ebbing support sparked concern that the window of opportunity for crushing both the left and the liberal republic might soon close. In the event, President Hindenburg’s advisors convinced him to appoint the leader of the NSDAP, Adolf Hitler, as chancellor less than three months later.
