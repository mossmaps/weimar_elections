    <p class="summarytext">The government called these elections two years early, after the grand coalition collapsed in a dispute over the increasingly critical issue of state funding for unemployment insurance, and as Germany saw its joblessness more than double from 1.37 million in 1928 to around three million by 1930. Those dire economic circumstances, along with zealous campaigning, propelled 82% of eligible voters to the polls, nearly equaling 1919’s record turnout.

    <p class="summarytext">Although the SPD managed to retain its status as the country’s largest party, with a quarter of the seats in the Reichstag (143 in total), the second-place NSDAP’s unprecedented nine-fold increase, from 12 seats to 107, made it the clear “winner” in this contest. In a little over two years and aided by a worsening depression that had predisposed voters to radical alternatives, the NSDAP had not only won over most of the rural constituencies that had cast their ballots in 1928 for economic-protest parties, but it had drawn in erstwhile DVP and DNVP supporters, as well. In the northern electoral district of Schleswig-Holstein, to give just one eye-opening example, the Nazis’ share of the vote rocketed from 4% in 1928 to 27% just two years later.

    <p class="summarytext">At the opposite political extreme, the KPD registered notable gains, too, adding 23 seats in the Reichstag and bringing its total to 77, within just ten seats of the third-place Catholic alliance of Zentrum/BVP. Given that the much-reduced DNVP still secured 41 seats, the 1930 elections created a Reichstag in which three of the five largest parties aimed to dismantle the Republic (NSDAP, DNVP, and KPD). Although these anti-republican parties did not yet have a legislative majority, their combined share of the vote in a number of individual electoral districts had already surpassed the 50% mark.
    </p>

    <p class="summarytext">In a sign of the times, the once reliably centrist and strongly pro-republic DDP had merged with an antisemitic political grouping just two months before the elections, in July 1930, and renamed itself the German State Party (DStP). This move did nothing to bolster the party’s support, which had plummeted by over 75% since 1919 and provided an especially vivid indication of middle-class German voters’ fraught relationship with the Weimar Republic.
