    <p class="summarytext">On January 30, President Hindenburg named Adolf Hitler chancellor of Germany. Two days later, Hitler dissolved the Reichstag and declared new elections for March 5. The Nazi-led government quickly harnessed the resources of both party and state to terrorize its opponents and flood the public with its own political message.

    <p class="summarytext">Under such decidedly un-free and un-fair conditions, almost every single party lost support—unsurprisingly—except for the NSDAP, which increased its share of the national vote by 10% to 43.9%. This still left the Nazis far short of an outright majority in the Reichstag, however, despite their countless campaign advantages. The SPD, facing censorship and intimidation, managed to garner 18% of the national vote and perform particularly well in the north-central electoral districts of Magdeburg and South Hanover-Brunswick. The Z/BVP, encountering less harassment, performed only slightly worse than usual, holding onto 14% of the national share and maintaining its status as the top vote-getter in two heavily Catholic western districts. Incredibly, the KPD mustered 12.3%, even though the Nazis had arrested every one of its leaders who had not already fled into exile or gone underground. The DNVP, meanwhile, in alliance with a far-right veterans’ organization and in sympathy with the Nazis, drew 8%, the only other party to gain a significant share of the vote.
    </p>

    <p class="summarytext">Only in tandem with its coalition partner, the DNVP, did the Nazi Party hold a majority of the Reichstag, but it wanted a 2/3 supermajority in order to pass a so-called “Enabling Act” that would suspend the legislative body and allow Hitler to rule by fiat.  After unilaterally annulling the KPD’s 81 seats on March 8 and then cajoling Z/BVP support, the Nazis won passage of the Enabling Act in the Reichstag on March 23, by a vote of 441 to 94. Only the SPD voted against it. Not long thereafter, the Nazi government banned all other parties outright and stripped the Reichstag of its remaining power.
