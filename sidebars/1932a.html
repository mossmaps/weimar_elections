   <p class="summarytext">Voter support for the Nazi Party in a free and fair election reached its high-water mark in July 1932, at a moment when almost a third of the German labor force could not find work, the state had slashed public services, and the president had imperiously sidelined the legislature. That trifecta of crises propelled a whopping 84.1% of eligible voters to the polls, another high-water mark. The results underscored the continued momentum of the NSDAP, which more than doubled its share of the vote (to 37.3%) and seats in the Reichstag (to 230) from two years earlier. Now the largest political party in Germany by a wide margin, the Nazis relegated the SPD to second place for the first time in the Weimar Republic.

    <p class="summarytext">Just a quick glance at the map shows this transformation, and an examination of individual electoral districts reveals even more clearly both the NSDAP’s dramatic gains and the SPD’s slightly less dramatic losses. In East Hanover, for instance, in the north-northwest of the country, nearly 33% had voted for the SPD in 1928 and a mere 2.6% for the NSDAP, but, just four years later, those figures were 24.5% and 49.5%, respectively. The NSDAP finished lower than second place in only one electoral district (Berlin), and it fell short of securing at least a quarter of the vote in only two districts—the heavily Catholic ones of Cologne-Aachen and Lower Bavaria. The Nazis had broadened their appeal to such an extent that more workers voted for them in July 1932 than for either of the two avowedly proletarian parties—the SPD and the KPD—even as the NSDAP further consolidated its electoral support among middle-class and lower-middle-class Protestants, including civil servants, retailers, artisans, and farmers.

    <p class="summarytext">The map suggests the general reluctance of the western and southern Catholic regions to vote for the NSDAP in numbers as large as those in the Protestant north. Indeed, electoral support for the Z/BVP, the political voice of German Catholics, proved remarkably stable throughout the Weimar Republic, as a perusal of the maps in chronological succession highlights. This stability—even in the dramatic elections of 1932—stood in stark contrast to the voter churn that buffeted every other party on the spectrum.

    <p class="summarytext">Apart from the NSDAP, only the KPD displayed significant electoral momentum in the July elections, having picked up another dozen seats in the Reichstag and increased its share of the vote to 14.3%. This produced a legislature in which a coalition government could only form a majority by including either the NSDAP or the KPD, the two most explicitly anti-republican parties in the body. In fact, those two parties—otherwise arch enemies—joined forces in September to compel the dissolution of the newly seated Reichstag and a fresh round of national voting just two months later.
