    <p class="summarytext">The SPD emerged as the clear winner of the 1928 elections, having captured nearly 30% of the national vote and more than twice as many seats in the Reichstag as the next-largest party. The party ran a potent campaign that promised welfare spending over weapons procurement, and it also benefited from reports that year that real wages had finally surpassed prewar levels, which resonated with its core constituency of skilled workers, in particular. A number of splinter parties on the right—including the Economic Party (WP) and several even smaller ones listed under the umbrella term “Other”— also registered significant gains, swelling from just over 7% of the national vote in the previous elections to nearly 14% in this one. These parties proved disproportionately popular in rural regions, where a precarious agricultural sector cast the economic outlook in a less rosy hue than elsewhere in Germany. On the far left, the KPD grew in support, too, making it the fourth-largest of the 14 parties in the Fourth Reichstag, with an especially strong presence in Germany’s industrial and mining centers.

    <p class="summarytext">The far right DNVP, meanwhile, showed the sharpest decline in electoral share, falling from 20.5% in December 1924 to just over 14% in these elections. Most of those former DNVP voters switched to a protest party during this period of remarkable churn on Germany’s political right, which also saw the Nazi Party (NSDAP) contesting a national election with its own list of candidates for the first time. The NSDAP drew its strongest support in rural areas, as well, but, with only 2.6% of the national vote, it registered as little more than a blip on the political scene. Meanwhile, the parties of the political center (DDP, Z/BVP, DVP) saw their support dwindle slightly, further indicating a more complicated political picture than this period’s generally positive economic statistics alone might have predicted. Together with the SPD, however, the republic-supporting parties controlled over 60% of the seats in the Reichstag and governed as a “Grand Coalition” for the next two years.
