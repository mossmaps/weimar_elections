    <p class="summarytext">The January 1919 election of representatives to a National Assembly drew an unprecedented number of voters to the polls—around two-and-a-half times more people cast a ballot on that day than had ever done so in a German election before, and they comprised 83% of all eligible voters. This record turnout reflected both popular enthusiasm for the new democracy and a dramatically expanded electorate. Women had the right to vote for the first time, and their 90% turnout surpassed that of men. Soldiers, too, could now vote, as could people as young as 20, down from the previous voting age of 25.
    </p>

    <p class="summarytext">Those voters had a wide array of parties to choose from, but fully 75% of them cast their ballots for one of the three “Weimar Coalition” parties (SPD, DDP, and Center) that had expressed the strongest and clearest support for republican democracy. The SPD attracted almost 38% of the vote, a higher percentage than any party had ever received in a German election (and the highest that any would receive in a free and fair one until 1953). The parties expressing skepticism or outright hostility toward republican democracy, meanwhile—including the center-right DVP, the far-right DNVP, and the far-left USPD—together mustered less than a quarter of the vote.
    </p>

    <p class="summarytext">The electoral map underscores the SPD’s broad, nationwide appeal, but it also highlights some key regional differences, especially the Center Party’s pronounced strength in the heavily Catholic areas of Bavaria and Baden, in the south; the Rhineland, in the west; and Silesia in the east. Two pockets in the industrial middle of Germany, meanwhile, registered the strongest support for the USPD, continuing a pattern of far-left voting in this mining and industrial region. Only one stretch of Germany in the east, along the contentious border with Poland, delivered a plurality of its votes to the far right, and the DNVP often failed to register even a second-place finish in many of the eastern districts that had been its traditional strongholds, which further reflected voters’ desire for change.</p>

    <p class="summarytext">The resulting National Assembly, with its pro-republic super majority, served two critical functions—(1) it framed and ratified a constitution for the new German democracy, and (2) it governed the country until a new parliament could be elected under the provisions of that constitution in 1920.</p>
