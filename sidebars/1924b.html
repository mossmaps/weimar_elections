    <p class="summarytext">Given the inability of the Reichstag that voters had just elected in May 1924 to form a stable government, President Ebert dissolved the legislature on October 20 and called for new elections. By the time voters went back to the polls on December 7, the mood of the country had improved significantly compared to seven months earlier. Prices had stabilized; capital began flowing into Germany in the form of foreign credits and investment; and the economy started to grow again. In addition, the August 1924 treaty arrangements that had enabled this influx of foreign money, known as the Dawes Plan, had also bolstered Germany’s international standing and reduced the salience of reparations as a domestic political issue, at least temporarily.

    <p class="summarytext">As a result, the December elections gently reversed the anti-republican voting trend of the previous two Reichstag elections and offered the first hint of stability after a remarkably tumultuous five years. All three “Weimar Coalition” parties—the ones expressing the strongest support for the Republic and its constitution—increased their share of the popular vote compared to the previous election, the first time in the Republic that this had happened. The SPD led this surge by capturing an additional 5.5% of the electorate and picking up 31 additional seats in the Reichstag. The Zentrum/BVP added 4% to its previous vote, while the DDP showed a more modest uptick of less than 1%. Just to the right of these three, the DVP, a party that had recently and decisively shed its earlier skepticism toward the Republic, also registered a small increase.

    <p class="summarytext">The parties on the political extremes, meanwhile, fared far worse. In the face of an improving economy, neither the far left’s nor the far right’s messages of dramatic change had as much appeal. The KPD lost just over a quarter of its seats in the Reichstag, and the alliance of extreme-right parties (DVFP), which included the Nazis, hemorrhaged more than half of its seats, having been further hampered by squabbling between the various groups.
