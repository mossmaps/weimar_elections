    <p class="summarytext">In early summer 1920, Germans voted for the first Reichstag (national legislature) to convene under the republic, replacing the National Assembly whose primary purpose—ratifying the country’s new constitution—had concluded the previous August. These 1920 elections also reflected, for the first time, the country’s reduced borders, after the Treaty of Versailles compelled Germany to cede territory to its various neighbors.</p>

    <p class="summarytext">Both the far left and the far right registered big gains, even as voter turnout overall dipped slightly to just over 79%. Outrage over the provisions of the Versailles Treaty, in particular, drove many voters away from the “Weimar Coalition” parties, whom they blamed for having signed it, but a general disillusionment with the emerging postwar order also made voters receptive to messages of political change. The far left captured a fifth of the vote—most of that went to the USPD, with 17.9%, but the Communists (KPD), running in their first nationwide election, secured 2.1%. The political right did even better, though, garnering almost 30% of the vote, with 13.9% going to the center-right DVP and 15.1% to the far-right DNVP. In other words, those parties expressing the deepest ambivalence toward the new the democratic republic had captured roughly half the vote. The Weimar Coalition’s share of the popular vote, meanwhile, fell by 28% compared to 1919, with the SPD and the DDP losing the largest share of voters—16% and 10%, respectively—while the Zentrum/BVP largely held on to its loyal Catholic base.

    <p class="summarytext">This map reveals some of the same regional voting patterns as the 1919 map, with the DNVP expanding on its earlier strength in the east and the Zentrum/BVP continuing to dominate in heavily Catholic areas like Bavaria and the Rhineland. At the same time, the map also highlights working-class voters’ marked leftward shift from the SPD to the USPD in key industrial regions of the country, such as the Ruhr, Thuringia, and Berlin. It illustrates, as well, the DVP’s strength among educated middle-class voters, particularly in the relatively prosperous towns and small cities in western Germany. Finally, it shows the briefly heightened appeal of the German Hanoverian Party (DHP, shown in gray on the map and listed as “Other”), which sought greater regional autonomy and highlighted the fissiparous impulses in the early republic.</p>

    <p class="summarytext">These elections produced a diverse and fragmented Reichstag in which only one party (the SPD) had managed to secure even a fifth of the seats, and subsequent efforts to cobble together a majority coalition demanded more willingness to compromise than either the SPD or the parties on the right could muster. Consequently, the Weimar Republic got its first of many minority governments, with a center-right coalition of the Zentrum/BVP, DDP, and DVP relying on the “toleration” of the SPD, and its additional hundred votes in the Reichstag, to keep the government in power.</p>
