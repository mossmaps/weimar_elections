    <p class="summarytext">Elections for the second Reichstag took place in the wake of a remarkably tumultuous autumn that had bewildered and angered voters. A humiliating expansion of the French and Belgian occupation in January 1923 spurred some of the worst hyperinflation ever recorded and contributed to another wave of far-left and far-right political agitation that culminated in the Nazi Party’s failed “Beer Hall Putsch” in November. Germany had only just begun to show signs of political and economic stability in early May, when slightly more than 77% of eligible voters went to the polls.</p>

    <p class="summarytext">These voters continued the earlier trend of shifting their support from the “Weimar Coalition” (SPD, DDP, Zentrum, and DVP) to the parties on the extreme left and right, which promised change. Support for the revolutionary KPD (the Communists) jumped from 2% of voters in 1920 to almost 13% by May 1924, as the party overtook the SPD in heavily working-class districts in western Germany. The far-right nationalist DNVP, meanwhile, steadily expanded its preeminence in the rural, Protestant stretches of eastern and northern Germany (blue on the map) and picked up an additional 5% of the overall vote, which put it almost even with the SPD in the Reichstag. The NSDAP (the Nazis) registered significant gains, too. Facing a two-year ban on taking part in elections after the failed putsch, it campaigned under the name of an allied ethnonationalist party, the DVFP. That far-right alliance captured 6.5% of the nationwide vote, with especially strong showings in Franconia, in south central Germany, and Mecklenburg, on the Baltic coast.

    <p class="summarytext">Because so many parties had gained seats in the Reichstag, including the most anti-republican ones, and because no single party held more than about one-fifth of those seats, it proved impossible to form a stable coalition government. After five months of failed attempts, therefore, President Friedrich Ebert dissolved the body and called new elections for December.
